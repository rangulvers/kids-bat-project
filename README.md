# Projects for Kids

This repository is a collection of projects that I have built with my kids. It serves as a fun and educational way to introduce them to the world of coding and technology. Each project is designed to be beginner-friendly and engaging, allowing children to learn and explore while having a great time.

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, simply clone this repository to your local machine. Each project is contained within its own directory, with detailed instructions and code samples provided. You can choose a project that suits your child's interests and follow the step-by-step guide to build it together.

## Projects


1. [Bats](./Arduino/Bats/): Our very first project. My kids wanted to know how bats can see. So we built our own bat ðŸ¦‡
2. [Scream-O-Mat](./Arduino/BigSound/Scream-O-Mat/): Ever wonder how loud your kids can be? Lets show them ðŸ“¢



Feel free to explore each project and customize them according to your child's preferences. Don't forget to encourage creativity and problem-solving skills along the way!
