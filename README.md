# Ultrasonic Sensor Bat Project

## Introduction 
This project simulates a bat's echolocation ability using an ultrasonic sensor, an active buzzer, and a MAX7219 LED matrix display. The project is designed to be educational and can be implemented in a classroom setting, teaching students about electronics, sensors, and programming with Arduino.

The project is divided into three stages to facilitate step-by-step learning:

Stage 1: Ultrasonic Sensor Only
Stage 2: Add Active Buzzer for Sound
Stage 3: Add MAX7219 Matrix Display
